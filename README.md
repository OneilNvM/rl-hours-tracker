<p align="center">A tracker made with Rust to record your hours and mimic Steam's <strong>'hours in the past two weeks'</strong> metric.</p>

---

## Synopsis

This was made specifically for the Epic Games version of Rocket League
as the Epic Games launcher has no way of showing the past two hours played in
the same way that steam is able to.

However, this program can and should still work with the steam version of the game.

It is `HIGHLY` recommended to not manually alter the files that are created by this program
otherwise it could lead to unwanted behaviour by the program

``` rust
 println!("You got it Oneil :)");
```

## Installing the program

- You can find the latest installer for the program in [Releases](https://github.com/OneilNvM/rl-hours-tracker/releases) section.
