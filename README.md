# Rocket League Hours Tracker
This was made specifically for the Epic Games version of Rocket League
as the Epic Games launcher has no way of showing the past two hours played in
the same way that steam is able to.
 
However, this program can and should still work with the steam version of the game.
 
It is `HIGHLY` recommended to not manually alter the files that are created by this program
otherwise it could lead to unwanted behaviour by the program

```
 println!("You got it Oneil :)");
```
